Joe's Hotdogs

Your assignment is to create a web page to get an order for a new café called “Joe’s Hotdog Stand”.
Joe’s only sells three items: hotdogs ($3.75 each), French Fries ($2.00 each) and Drinks ($1.80 each).
Joe is swamped with takeout orders due to Covid and is hoping online orders will help to manage the flow better so that customers will have a better experience.
When the user runs the page (i.e., enters the url) do the following:

-Using prompt(), ask the user three questions- how many hotdogs do they want, how many fries do they want and how many sodas do they want.
  When you get the values, store them in variables or an array.

-Calculate the subtotal for the order based on the pricing and the quantities requested. 
  Store in a variable.

-Implement Joe’s special offer - 10% discount if the order (before tax) is at least $20.  
  Update the subtotal.  Store the discount amount in a variable.

-Add 6.25% Massachusetts meals tax to the subtotal.  This is the final amount the customer will need to pay.

-Display all order information on the page including:  

  -Items ordered and quantities
  
  -subtotals
  
  -discount if applicable
  
  -tax
  
  -final total.  
  
  All currency values must be rounded to 2 decimal places.
